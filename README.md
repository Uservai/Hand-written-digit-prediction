# Handwritten Digit Prediction 🖊️🔢

This project builds a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model using TensorFlow/Keras to recognize handwritten digits (0–9) from the MNIST dataset.  
The goal is to classify digits with high accuracy by training a deep learning model.

## 🔥 Features
- Preprocessed and normalized the MNIST dataset
- Built a CNN model with convolutional, pooling, and dense layers
- Applied dropout and batch normalization to prevent overfitting
- Achieved high accuracy on test data
- Visualized training history (accuracy vs loss)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📚 Libraries Used
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
